Project Summary
This project analyzes a dataset of over 160,000 Spotify tracks spanning a century to identify key trends in audio features, song characteristics, and artist popularity. The analysis was performed using Python, and the final insights were visualized in an interactive Tableau dashboard.

Technologies Used
Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Dashboard: Tableau

IDE: Jupyter Notebook

Project Workflow
Data Preparation: Loaded the raw dataset, performed cleaning, and engineered new features like decade and duration_s using Pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth analysis in Python to uncover trends, correlations, and distributions within the data.

Visualization: Exported the cleaned dataset to a CSV and built an interactive dashboard in Tableau to present the findings.

Key Insights & Findings
Music has become consistently louder and more energetic over the last 100 years.

The average duration of songs has shown a decreasing trend, especially in the last two decades.

Explicit songs tend to have higher average popularity and energy scores compared to non-explicit tracks.

A strong positive correlation exists between a song's energy and its loudness.

The distribution of popularity is heavily skewed, with most songs having low popularity and a few being mega-hits.

Interactive Dashboard
The final interactive dashboard provides a visual deep-dive into the trends and insights discovered during the analysis.
